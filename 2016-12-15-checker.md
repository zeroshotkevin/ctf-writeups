#### Meta
`checker` was a 300 point exploitation challenge from SECCON Quals 2016.  The original binary and challenge description can be found [here](https://github.com/ctfs/write-ups-2016).

#### Solution
The program is pretty simple: you are prompted for your name, and then prompted with `Do you know the flag?` in a loop until you answer `yes`.  You are then asked to guess the flag, and the program will indicate success or failure.

The `getaline()` function will `read()` one byte at a time until newline or null is reached, and has no bounds checking at all.  It gives arbitrary-length overwrites anywhere it is used in the program.  `main()` uses this function three times: when it prompts `Do you know the flag?`, when it asks for the flag, and when it asks your name.  I'll handle these one at a time:

* `Hello! What is your name?` - this call to `getaline()` reads input into `name`, a global variable in the .bss section.  It sits just before `flag`, the global buffer that holds the flag itself.  This overwrite allows us to overwrite the flag, and nothing else.  Unfotunately, `getaline()` always puts a null at the end of any string read, so any possibility of leaking the flag via a printf that involves `name` won't work.

* `Please tell me the flag!` - this call to `getaline()` reads input into a buffer on the stack.  The bad news is that the program uses gcc's stack-smashing protector (SSP); without a solid leak of the stack canary, any attempt to overwrite a return address on the stack will fail (and there is no such leak in this case).  However there is another possibility: using the `__stack_chk_fail()` function itself to print the flag.

`__stack_chk_fail()` is interesting in that it calls `__fortify_fail()` which uses the `argv[0]` pointer from the stack:

```c
void
__attribute__ ((noreturn))
__fortify_fail (msg)
     const char *msg;
{
  /* The loop is added only to keep gcc happy.  */
  while (1)
    __libc_message (2, "*** %s ***: %s terminated\n",
            msg, __libc_argv[0] ?: "<unknown>");
}
```

In cases that you have ability to *not only* overwrite stack canary but can also overwrite the `argv[0]` pointer on the stack, you can print out pretty much anything from memory you want.  In this case, it's the `flag` global buffer.

Unfortunately there's extra complications with this binary since it's 64-bit.  `flag` sits at the fixed address of `0x6010c0`.  The `argv[0]` pointer will be a stack address likely in the range of `0x7fffffffxxxx`, a 64-bit address.  We can easily overwrite the bottom 32-bits of the `argv[0]` pointer, and even let `getaline()` write a single null byte for us in the top-half of the address, but we *can't quite* overwrite the entire address to point to `flag`.  That is where the third call to `getaline()` becomes important.

* `Do you know flag?` - there is a loop in main that will continually prompt this message until you answer with `yes`.  This loop reads your response into the same stack buffer that will later be used to overwrite `argv[0]`, so we get unlimited overwrites before we send `yes`.  With that in mind, we can **zero out** the entire `argv[0]` pointer on the stack by sending 8 overwrites of descending length, starting with overwriting the very last byte of `argv[0]` with a null.  Once `argv[0]` has been nulled out completely, send `yes`, then send the overwrite with the address of `flag`.  Once `__fortify_fail()` is triggered, it will spit out the flag.  Final code is as follows:

```python
from pwn import *

io = remote('checker.pwn.seccon.jp', 14726)

io.sendline('me')
print io.readline()
num_As = 48*8-1
for i in range(0, 7):
    io.sendline('A'*num_As)
    num_As -= 1
    print io.readline()
io.sendline('A'*(47*8) + p64(0x6010C0))
io.interactive()
```
