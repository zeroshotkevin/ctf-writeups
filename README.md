# dropkick's CTF writeups

A loose collection of some of the CTF solutions I've come up.  Quality of editing may vary.  Some of these are pulled from an old personal blog that I let dissolve into the ether.

| Problem       | CTF Name    | Description |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| [Gold Stash](https://github.com/dropk1ck/ctf-writeups/blob/master/2014-12-1-gold-stash.md) | hack.lu      | Simple reversing challenge that also required some on-box enumeration |
| [rolling](https://github.com/dropk1ck/ctf-writeups/blob/master/2014-12-2-rolling.md) | 9447 ctf  | A fun reversing challenge that I short-circuted with instruction counting as a side-channel attack |
| [PwnAdventure3 Cows](https://github.com/dropk1ck/ctf-writeups/blob/master/2015-01-30-pwnadventure-cows.md) | Ghost In the Shell 2015  | One of the best CTF problems ever made: [PwnAdventure3](https://www.pwnadventure.com/) a MMORPG that's also meant to be hacked. This write-up is specifically for the 'Cows' level.|
| [PwnAdventure3 Egghunter](https://github.com/dropk1ck/ctf-writeups/blob/master/2015-01-31-pwnadventure-egghunter.md) | Ghost In the Shell 2015  | Same as above, but the Egg Hunter challenge instead.|
| [Hello Joe](https://github.com/dropk1ck/ctf-writeups/blob/master/2015-12-1-hellojoe.md) | 9447 CTF  | Reversing challenge involving Capstone disassembler and constraint solving on disassembled routines |
| [Bob's Hat](https://github.com/dropk1ck/ctf-writeups/blob/master/2016-03-17-bobs-hat.md) | Boston Key Party  | Breaking RSA in all ways possible |
| [JIT In My Pants](https://github.com/dropk1ck/ctf-writeups/blob/master/2016-03-20-jit-in-my-pants.md) | Boston Key Party  | More reversing, but also while defeating side-channel protection measures |
| [checker](https://github.com/dropk1ck/ctf-writeups/blob/master/2016-12-15-checker.md) | SECCON Quals| Using __stack_chk_fail() against itself |
| [risky](https://github.com/dropk1ck/ctf-writeups/blob/master/hitcon-quals-2015-risky.md) | HITCON Quals| Reversing RISC-V binaries before it was cool |
| [PostIt (Hardened)](https://github.com/dropk1ck/ctf-writeups/blob/master/pwnies-postit_hardened.md) | ???? | A CTF problem written by Pwnies and posted online for all to try. An incredibly weird dprintf() exploit that requires a ROP chain from hell. |
| [rope](https://gist.github.com/dropk1ck/7fa17e1996ebf43bd773634ce6f0b652) | HackTheBox | My Chrome exploit for the first portion of the HTB box 'rope' |
| [keygenme](https://github.com/dropk1ck/ctf-writeups/blob/master/reddit-reversing-keygenmev7.md) | Reddit /REmath | Solution to a random RE/keygen challenge that was once posted to reddit /REmath subreddit |
