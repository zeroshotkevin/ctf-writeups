Rolling your own stuff is pretty good :)
The flag format is 9447{$STR}, where $STR is the one accepted by the binary.
Note: This challenge is the only challenge to break the 9447{string} flag format. If $STR is the solution and the one accepted by the binary, please submit the flag as 9447{$STR} by manually adding the 9447{}.
```

`rolling` is a stripped 64-bit Linux binary that checks `argv[1]` for the correct 'password'.  The goal is to reverse the binary to figure out that string (which is the flag according to the problem description). The first interesting part of the program is `sub_4006C7`, which contains the following code blocks:

To summarize, `argv[1]` must start with a number, or else we end up deobfuscating and running a code block contained at `0x6018e0`.  The code at this location, when disassembled, gives a hint that flags start with the string `9447` (note this is different from the submission flag format, which ALSO starts with 9447). Experimentation also quickly shows that putting anything besides `9447` as the first 4 chars of `argv[1]` crashes the program. `func2()` is a decryption function that takes a pointer to a block of encrypted code, a size value, and the first char of `argv[1] - 0x37`.  The code at location `0x601060`, when deobfuscated by `func2()`, looks like the code we’re after:

```asm
   0x7ffff7ff7000:  push   rbp
   0x7ffff7ff7001:  mov    rbp,rsp
   0x7ffff7ff7004:  mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],rdi
   0x7ffff7ff7008:  mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
   0x7ffff7ff700c:  movzx  eax,BYTE PTR [rax]
   0x7ffff7ff700f:  cmp    al,0x39
   0x7ffff7ff7011:  jne    0x7ffff7ff7217
   0x7ffff7ff7017:  mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
   0x7ffff7ff701b:  add    rax,0x1
   0x7ffff7ff701f:  movzx  eax,BYTE PTR [rax]
   0x7ffff7ff7022:  cmp    al,0x34
   0x7ffff7ff7024:  jne    0x7ffff7ff7217
   0x7ffff7ff702a:  mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
   0x7ffff7ff702e:  add    rax,0x2
   0x7ffff7ff7032:  movzx  eax,BYTE PTR [rax]
   0x7ffff7ff7035:  cmp    al,0x34
   0x7ffff7ff7037:  jne    0x7ffff7ff7217
   0x7ffff7ff703d:  mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
   0x7ffff7ff7041:  add    rax,0x3
   0x7ffff7ff7045:  movzx  eax,BYTE PTR [rax]
   0x7ffff7ff7048:  cmp    al,0x37
   0x7ffff7ff704a:  jne    0x7ffff7ff7217
```

It continues in that fashion but gets slightly more complicated by basing later chars in the string off mathematical operations on other chars in the string. At this point I decided to take a lesson from barrebas and superkojiman’s solution for baleful from picoctf 2014 and try solving with PIN (a little overkill, but I like black-box approaches):

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
from subprocess import check_output

pin_path = '/home/dropkick/src/pin-2.14-linux/'
pintool = '/source/tools/ManualExamples/obj-intel64/inscount0.so'
validchars = [chr(c) for c in range(0x30, 0x7f)]

def get_inscount():
    fd = open('inscount.out')
    inscount = fd.read().split()[1]
    fd.close()
    return int(inscount)

def run_rolling(flag):
    return check_output([pin_path+'pin', '-t', pin_path+pintool, '--', './rolling', flag])

# We know flags start with 9447
flag = '9447'

# Establish baseline instruction count
run_rolling(flag)
base_inscount = get_inscount()

# Main loop
while True:
    for c in validchars:
        print 'Trying flag {0}...'.format(flag+c)
        output = run_rolling(flag + c)
        if 'Llongyfarchiadau' in output:
            print 'Victory! The flag is: {0}'.format(flag+c)
            quit()
        inscount = get_inscount()
        if inscount > base_inscount:
            base_inscount = inscount
            # We found the next character
            flag = flag + c
            print 'Found next char, flag is now: {0}'.format(flag)
            break 
```

And eventually we get: `Victory! The flag is: 9447rollingisfun`
